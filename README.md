# Barney
A simple Discord Bot. Mostly for learning the Discord API and making small tools for our server.

I use Jupyter notebooks to experiment with the API; that code is usually pretty half-baked. The directory structure is my first crack at using a proper Python design pattern for a personal project. That will slowly improve over time.

Barney is hosted on an EC2 Amazon Linux instance on AWS. One mid-term action item is to create a deployment pipeline so Barney can be upgraded seamlessly with minimal downtime.

The long term goal is to implement data tagging of conversations for the development of a weak chatbot tuned to our Discord server.
